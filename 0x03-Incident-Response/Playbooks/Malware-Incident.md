# 🦠 Malware Incident Response Playbook

## 1. Purpose
This playbook defines the standard response process for handling malware-related security incidents detected by the SOC.

Its objective is to ensure rapid containment, minimize impact, preserve evidence, and restore affected systems safely.

---

## 2. Scope
This playbook applies to:
- Endpoints (workstations, laptops)
- Servers
- Malware detected via EDR, SIEM, or antivirus alerts

---

## 3. Detection Sources
Malware incidents may be detected through:
- EDR alerts
- Antivirus detections
- Suspicious PowerShell or process activity
- Network-based detections
- User reports

---

## 4. Initial Triage (First 5–10 Minutes)
SOC analysts must quickly answer the following:

- Is the alert credible?
- What system is affected?
- Is the malware active or contained?
- Is there evidence of lateral movement?

### Immediate Actions
- Validate the alert details
- Identify affected host and user
- Check severity and confidence level
- Determine if multiple systems are involved

---

## 5. Severity Classification
| Severity | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Low | Isolated malware, blocked or quarantined |
| Medium | Malware execution without lateral movement |
| High | Malware with persistence, privilege escalation, or spread |

Severity determines escalation and response urgency.

---

## 6. Containment
Containment aims to stop the spread while preserving evidence.

### Short-Term Containment
- Isolate affected endpoint from the network
- Disable compromised user accounts if applicable
- Block malicious indicators (hash, IP, domain)

### Considerations
- Avoid rebooting systems prematurely
- Document all actions taken

---

## 7. Eradication
Once containment is achieved:

- Remove malware artifacts
- Delete malicious files and scripts
- Terminate malicious processes
- Close exploited vulnerabilities
- Remove persistence mechanisms

Ensure eradication steps are verified before recovery.

---

## 8. Recovery
Restore systems to normal operation:

- Reimage or clean affected systems if required
- Apply patches and updates
- Reset credentials if compromise is suspected
- Monitor systems closely for recurrence

Recovery is complete only after validation.

---

## 9. Evidence Preservation
During all phases:
- Preserve logs
- Capture memory or disk images if required
- Maintain chain of custody
- Store evidence securely

This is critical if DFIR or legal actions are required.

---

## 10. Escalation Criteria
Escalate to DFIR or management if:
- Malware shows persistence or lateral movement
- Sensitive data may be impacted
- Multiple systems are affected
- Attack sophistication is high

---

## 11. Lessons Learned
After incident closure:
- Document root cause
- Improve detection rules
- Update playbooks
- Conduct awareness or training if needed

Every malware incident is an opportunity to strengthen defenses.
