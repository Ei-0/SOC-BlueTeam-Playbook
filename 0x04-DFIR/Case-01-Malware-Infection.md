# Case 01 – Malware Infection

## 📌 Incident Summary
A malware infection was detected on a corporate workstation following suspicious process execution and abnormal network behavior.

The detection originated from endpoint security telemetry indicating malicious activity consistent with post-exploitation techniques.

The incident required immediate containment to prevent potential lateral movement and further compromise.

## 🕵️ Detection Source
- EDR Alert (Suspicious Process Behavior)
- SIEM Correlated Alert
- Windows Security Logs

---

## 🖥️ Affected Asset
- Asset Type: User Workstation
- Operating System: Windows 10
- User Context: Standard Domain User

---

## ⏰ Incident Timeline (High-Level)
- Suspicious process execution detected
- Outbound connection to suspicious domain observed
- Endpoint isolated by SOC
- DFIR investigation initiated

---

## ⚠️ Severity
**Medium → High**

---

## 🎯 Initial Impact Assessment
- Single endpoint compromised
- No immediate evidence of lateral movement
- Potential credential exposure
- Risk of persistence mechanisms

# Logs Analysis

## 🔍 Windows Security Logs
The following events were identified during analysis:

- Event ID 4688 – Suspicious process creation
- Parent-child process anomaly observed
- Execution from non-standard directory

---

## 🧠 Process Analysis
- Suspicious executable launched via PowerShell
- Command-line arguments indicate potential payload execution
- Process behavior inconsistent with user role

---

## 🌐 Network Activity
- Outbound connection to unknown external domain
- Communication over non-standard port
- Traffic pattern consistent with command-and-control (C2) activity

---

## 🧩 Correlation Findings
Correlating endpoint, process, and network logs confirms malicious activity rather than user error or misconfiguration.

# Forensic Timeline

| Time | Event |
|-----|------|
| 09:14 | PowerShell process executed |
| 09:15 | Suspicious executable launched |
| 09:16 | Outbound connection initiated |
| 09:18 | EDR alert triggered |
| 09:20 | Endpoint isolated |

# Final DFIR Report – Case 01

## 🧠 Root Cause
The infection was caused by execution of a malicious payload delivered through a suspicious PowerShell command, likely originating from a phishing-related vector.

---

## 🛑 Containment Actions
- Endpoint isolated from network
- Malicious process terminated
- User credentials reset as precaution

---

## 🧹 Eradication
- Malicious files removed
- Persistence mechanisms eliminated
- System scanned and cleaned

---

## 🔄 Recovery
- System restored to operational state
- Monitoring increased for affected user
- Endpoint returned to network after validation

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Enhanced PowerShell logging is critical
- User awareness training should be reinforced
- Detection rules updated for similar behavior
