# 🧱 Foundations

## Overview
This section establishes the foundational concepts required to understand how a modern Security Operations Center (SOC) operates.

It provides the theoretical and operational context that supports all subsequent sections, including detection engineering, incident response, DFIR, and threat hunting.

---

## Objectives
- Build a clear understanding of SOC operations
- Explain how SIEM platforms are used in daily SOC work
- Define the incident response lifecycle and escalation logic
- Introduce MITRE ATT&CK from a SOC analyst perspective

---

## Contents

### 🛡️ SOC Overview
Explains:
- What a SOC is and its core responsibilities
- SOC analyst roles (L1, L2, L3)
- Alert lifecycle and SOC workflows
- Relationship between SOC, IR, and DFIR

---

### 🧠 SIEM Fundamentals
Covers:
- SIEM core functions (collection, normalization, correlation)
- Alerting vs investigation
- False positives vs true positives
- SIEM use cases and detection mindset

---

### 🚨 Incident Response Lifecycle
Details:
- NIST Incident Response phases
- When to contain vs investigate
- Escalation and severity handling
- Evidence preservation considerations

---

### 🎯 MITRE ATT&CK Overview
Introduces:
- ATT&CK structure (Tactics, Techniques, Sub-techniques)
- Why ATT&CK matters for SOC operations
- Using ATT&CK for detection, investigation, and hunting
- ATT&CK-driven security strategy

---

## How This Section Is Used
The Foundations section provides the conceptual framework used throughout the project.

All detection logic, response playbooks, DFIR investigations, and threat hunting activities are aligned with the principles defined here.

---

## Outcome
This section demonstrates a strong operational understanding of SOC concepts and establishes the analytical mindset required for effective security monitoring and response.
