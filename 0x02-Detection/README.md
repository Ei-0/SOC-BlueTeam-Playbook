# 🎯 Detection Engineering

## Overview
This section focuses on detection engineering within a Security Operations Center (SOC).

It demonstrates how security events are transformed into actionable alerts using structured detection use cases and standardized detection rules.

---

## Objectives
- Detect malicious activity early in the attack lifecycle
- Reduce false positives through contextual analysis
- Align detections with real adversary behavior
- Map detections to the MITRE ATT&CK framework

---

## Detection Components

### 🔔 Use Cases
Each use case represents a real-world attack scenario and includes:
- Threat scenario description
- Relevant log sources
- Detection logic
- Alert context
- Common false positives
- SOC analyst response guidance

### 🧩 Sigma Rules
Sigma rules provide:
- SIEM-agnostic detection logic
- Standardized rule structure
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Reusable detection content

---

## Covered Scenarios
- Brute Force Attacks
- Suspicious Login Activity
- PowerShell Abuse
- Data Exfiltration

---

## Outcome
This section demonstrates practical detection engineering skills and highlights how behavioral detection improves SOC effectiveness.
